# Simple-stopwatch
The Simple Stopwatch project is a command-line-based Java application designed to provide users with a basic stopwatch functionality. 
It enables users to start, stop, and reset a timer while displaying the elapsed time in a user-friendly "HH:mm:ss" format. 


This project is an excellent showcase of fundamental programming concepts, including the use of functions to manage timer operations, 
efficient time handling through system time functions, and user interaction via a command-line menu. It serves as an educational resource for those learning Java,
offering a practical example of how to work with date and time, handle user input, and organize code into functions. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, 
this project illustrates essential programming concepts in an accessible manner.
